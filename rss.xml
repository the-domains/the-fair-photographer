            <title><![CDATA[Anyone who has shot enough weddings knows that it is less than ideal to only have 45mins to shoot your locations. BUT! These people also know how awesome it is when instincts kick in. We ripped across the road to Centennial Park for this shot, back toward the Great Eastern Highway/Hannan St. Obviously not the most picturesque of backdrops, but when you're in the zone, magic happens. Brent and Candice were sooo chill with everything. They were a great couple to shoot, and we had a heap of laughs together, and I always love being privileged enough to share such special days with people. P.S. Having a stunning couple to shoot helps A LOT too haha. @welovekb]]></title>
